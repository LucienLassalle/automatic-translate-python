# Automatic-Translate-Python

This is a project to automatically manage video game translations from the paratranz site by playing with APIs, including DeepL, google, Systran.
This project is not intended to be sold, it is a student project.


## Information

Currently no documentation is provided. We were working on creating a website that would interface with Python code to translate many files more efficiently.

We would also like to improve it in order to cover 95% of translations using Artificial Intelligence to check the consistency of the translation.

We also use Python libraries, and we want to avoid users having to install a batch of dependencies just for a script. This is why no deployment or operating instructions have been written.

Thank you for your support, developer friend!
